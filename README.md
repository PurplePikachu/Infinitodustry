In the future... this will be the everyday content                                                                                         
No this is not going to be a 6.0 example mod. Thought it may be implemented

Current plan on progress here is as following:                                                                                                                                     
-Integrate sk7725's EXP-LIB with the mod                                                                                                                                           
-Make global research nodes (ones also affecting cores)                                                                                                                         
-Just wait till modded items can be actually researched
