Coloring role: Cyan/Lime/Orange
Fighting location: Divine Asteroid field, or anywhere where a mere mortal would place "Divine Altar"
Tier: God

--Roach
Equiped with various defensive devices, these drones excell at blocking an area from enemy fire. Them being situational as they are, they aren't mass produced. And even then, when they have their use, its often visible. Oh yeah and they are fast for their size.
Coloring role: Lime/Blue
Tier: 5

Coloring role: Cyan/Lime
Tier: 5

Misterious "drones", which serve differing purposes based off their design, which all share same weapon design (Divinity uses that weapon type too to an extent). Serves as "bosses", which have specific playgrounds and mechanics, while some may appear randomly.

-Messanger
Mothership, which launches small Messy attack drones. Said drones are often used to distract enemy deffenses if they were to fire while Messanger would send it's prophecies (whatever Divinity would want to be sent to them).

Coloring role: Purple/Red
Fighting location: Any
Tier: unknown

--Inquisitor
Most trusted of regular drones, allowing them to equip double-egded detection system.
